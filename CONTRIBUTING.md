# Contributing to cs-vm-build

The JMU Unix Users Group welcomes contributions to its projects. This document
is not intended to serve as a list of rules for contributing to JMU UUG
projects, but rather its intent is to document the process and prepare
potential contributors for what to expect.

This document assumes a basic knowledge of `git` and GitHub. For an intro to
both of these, see our `git`
[intro guide](https://jmunixusers.github.io/presentations/Git.html).


## Getting started

Before adding a new feature or a new course, please
[open an issue](https://github.com/jmunixusers/cs-vm-build/issues/new) to start
discussion before beginning work. This will prevent several people accidentally
working on the same feature and will ensure that everyone has a similar goal
for the new feature.

Please keep in mind that this project is specifically focused on providing a
service to JMU's CS department and students. Some feature requests may not be
approved if they stray too far away from that goal.


## Reporting issues

It is significantly easier to troubleshoot issues when detailed bug reports are
provided. Effective bug reports generally contain:

 - Complete logs or recent entries from logs generated by Ansible and the
   wrapper script. These files are located at:
   - `/var/log/vmtools/ansible_runs.log`
   - `~/.cache/uug_ansible_wrapper.log`
 - A description of troubleshooting steps taken
 - Exact error message text or screenshots

Clearly not all of these will apply to all issues; however, it's often easier
for us to parse through extra information than to collect additional
information.


## Submitting pull requests

Pull requests should be targeted to `master` unless they're fixing a particular
issue in a release. Once issues are in `master`, they may be backported. This
allows us to ensure that the next release of the VM includes all fixes that
are in the current release.

We strongly suggest doing your work in topic branches for the particular pull
request; this will make testing significantly easier for you and for the UUG.


## Pull request reviews

Your pull request will be reviewed by at least one member of the UUG Virtual
Machine team. We require all pull requests (even ones from UUG Virtual Machine
team members) to go through a review process before merging. Your reviewers may
request that some changes be made before merging or may merge your pull
request as-is.

Reviewers are encouraged to provide specific feedback and help contributors
improve their patches.


## Testing

Performing a few tests before submitting a pull request can significantly
decrease the amount of time before your PR is merged and will make life much
easier for your reviewers. We recommend the following for testing:

 - Have a dedicated VM for testing your fixes that you don't use for other work
 - In the JMU CS VM Configuration program:
   - Go to File > Settings...
   - Change the branch to `master`
   - Change the URL to `https://github.com/jmunixusers/cs-vm-build`
   - Re-run the base configuration and all roles that your change will affect
   - Change the branch and URL to where you pushed your changes
   - Re-run the base configuration and all roles that your change will affect

At this point, you can test and ensure that your change works as expected. If
your change affects Java, please try to compile a basic Java "Hello world"
program in each of: DrJava, jGRASP, and Eclipse. If your change affects `gcc`
or similar utilities, please try to compile a basic C "Hello world" program.


## Backporting fixes

When a fix needs to be backported from master to a particular release, the
following has worked relatively well.

 - Locally checkout a new branch based on `master`
 - Run `git pull https://github.com/jmunixusers/cs-vm-build master`
 - Run `git cherry-pick <COMMIT_HASH>` for each commit that needs to be
   backported.
 - Run `git push origin BRANCH`
 - Create a pull request targeting the release the fix is for

Backports go through the same review process as any other commits. In the pull
request, please reference the number of the pull request from when the fix was
merged into `master`.


## Preparing for a release

Release branches have the same name as the Linux Mint release that they
correlate with. For example, `sylvia` or `tara`.

Tags have the following naming scheme: `RELEASE-SSYYA` where:
 - `RELEASE` is the Linux Mint codename for the release
 - `SS` is either `fa` for fall releases for `sp` for spring releases
 - `YY` is the last two digits of the calendar year of the release
 - `A` is an alphabetical release.

For example, the first release in the spring of 2018 was `sylvia-sp18a` and
if subsequent releases had been necessary, they would have been named
`sylvia-sp18b` and `sylvia-sp18c`, etc. The first release in fall 2018 was
`tara-fa18a`.

## Adding a new role

Assuming you have your git operations in order, the first thing you will need
to do to begin working on your ansible role is to create the directory. We will
start in the base `cs-vm-build` directory that you get when cloning the
jmunixusers repo. First move into the `roles/` folder, and create a directory
for your role using the `ansible-galaxy` command:
```
ansible-galaxy init [your class name/description]
```
This has very little output but once it finishes, go into the newly created
directory to find a host of new folders and a readme. Every folder (generally)
contains a `main.yml` file that will be your base for your new role. Try to
keep to the `tasks/main.yml` and `vars/main.yml` if you are unsure about
where to put things, though there are good reasons to use other folders/files.

As you will see in many of the other roles, any lists are generally kept to the
`vars` folder, since it places them in a place that is easy to access and
decoupled from the actual implementation of what those variables are needed for.

One last note; we have tried to avoid using external ansible modules, as
they are usually simply a shell command wrapped in a python script. For any
install that can be done with a `command` module call instead of a more specific
module generally should, as using a seperate module would require installing
that module on every VM, as we are not using ansible as it was designed.

Afterwords, simply add your role to the `roles.yml` file in the root of the
project. It should be fairly obvoius to see, but just in case here is the
layout:
```
- { role: [role name], tags: ['tags'] )
```

Now we are ready to edit the python installer. Navagate to
`cs-vm-build/roles/common/files` and open `uug_ansible_wrapper.py`. You will
be greeted with a long and hard to read python file, but luckily the only thing
we need to edit is very early in the file. On line 33 (at the time of writing)
there is a dictionary of classes and tags, this is where we will be adding our
class. The first value is what the class will appear as in the install program,
and the second value will be the role name from the `roles.yml` file we added
earlier.
